The Culverin fits right between those two segments. For the advanced and pro players the first part of the flight will be straight and it will finish with a dependable fade. If you are looking for a dependable fairway driver that you still can get some decent distance out of, Culverin is the answer. Aim, shoot, hit your mark.",
